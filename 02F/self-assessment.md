Your name (print clearly in capital letters): \underline{\hspace{9.2cm}}

This is both a self-assessment for you and a report of progress for our class. Please **return this assessment to Colton by 8:50am**. 

Recall that in-class participation, reading, problem sets count for about $3/10$ of your grade in this course. Since this is the first week (and there are around $15$ weeks this term), the work you did this week should be worth about $3/150 = 1/50 = 2\%$ of your final grade. 

## Graded Questions

1. (4 points) Did you participate in class this week? For each day in the set $\{\text{Monday}, \text{Wednesday}, \text{Friday}\}$, answer in the table below. Please write 0 if you were *absent*, write 1 if you were *present but did not participate*, or write 2 if you *participated*.

2. (4 points) Did you read or study the reading material between classes this week? For each day in the set $\{\text{Monday}, \text{Wednesday}, \text{Friday}\}$, answer in the table below. Please write 0 if you *did not prepare at all*, write 1 if you were *prepared but did not have time to read*, or write 2 if you *made time to read before class*.

3. (4 points) Did you attempt and complete Wednesday's worksheet?^[If you were stumped/stuck/confused, did you go to the MARC or office hours to ask for help?] Please write 0 if you *did not try at all*, write $1$ if you *tried but did not complete any problems*, write $2$ if you *completed half of the problems*, write $3$ if you *completed all of the problems*, and write $4$ if you *completed all of the problems* and *checked your answers with another person*.

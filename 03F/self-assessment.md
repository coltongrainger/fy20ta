Your name (print clearly in capital letters): \underline{\hspace{9.2cm}}

This is both a self-assessment for you and a report of progress for our class. Please **return this assessment to Colton by 8:50am**. 

Recall that in-class participation, reading, problem sets count for about $3/10$ of your grade in this course. Since this is the first week (and there are around $15$ weeks this term), the work you did this week should be worth about $3/150 = 1/50 = 2\%$ of your final grade. 

## Graded Questions

1. (6 points) Did you participate in class this week? For each day in the set $\{\text{Monday}, \text{Wednesday}, \text{Friday}\}$, answer in the table below. Please write 0 if you were *absent*, write 1 if you were *present but did not participate*, or write 2 if you *participated*.

` ` | Monday | Wednesday | Friday
--- | --- | --- | ---
`participation points` | | | 

 
2. (6 points) Did you read or study the reading material between classes this week? For each day in the set $\{\text{Monday}, \text{Wednesday}, \text{Friday}\}$, answer in the table below. Please write 0 if you *did not prepare at all*, write 1 if you were *prepared but did not have time to read*, or write 2 if you *made time to read before class*.

` ` | Monday | Wednesday | Friday

3. (6 points) Did you prepare solutions to any of the sections of the in-class hand-outs?^[If you were stumped/stuck/confused, did you go to the MARC or office hours to ask for help?] Please write 0 if you *did not try at all*, write $1$ if you *completed less than half of the problems*, write $2$ if you *completed more than half of the problems*.

## Ungraded Questions

1. (0 points) Do you pledge that the above work was completed with academic integrity?  (Explain?)

2. (0 points) Here is the `DONE` list from our schedule. I invite you to leave comments in the right column on this page for me to read. I also invite you to ask another student how they answered. 

> **Prompt.** What material do you think we should have:  
>
> i. skipped? removed completely? totally left out?
> i. spent a little less time talking about?
> i. spent much more time talking about?
> i. should have included?



- Bring you calculator to class tomorrow!

- deadline to setup your WebAssign account is sept. 9th (I'm sorry; we just have to do it. Note the free trial ends 2 weeks after Aug 26. If you have emailed me, please read here as well.) There's support during the afternoons in the MARC (Math 175). If you cannot log on, read this introduction, then go to the MARC at lunch time to meet with a Cengage representative. You will likely need to purchase an access code. You do not need a copy of the textbook.

- skim "2.1.4 Variance and standard deviation" and "2.1.5 Box plots, quartiles, and the median" in openintro statistics

- read "why study probability?" by Blitzstein and Hwang

- (optional) watch "Lecture 1: Probability and Counting" by J. Blitzstein

- read "statistics and probability intro" problem set and choose a problem to present

- read "elementary set theory and probabilities" problem set and choose a problem to present

- (optional) watch probability theory from a historical perspective Slides from the Probability theory lecture. Part A deals with the definition of probability theory and the setup, Part B deals with combinatorics, Part C wit...

- (optional) extra review for the definition of a set

- (optional) read Mary Boaz's advice "to the student"

## Our Common Goal

Mathematics is a *language*; I want to give you practice *speaking the language* before we get *lost in the weeds* of probability (which is chapter 4 of *Understandable Statistics*).

Therefore, each person in each (simulated) research group should **complete a presentation problem between Monday and Friday of next week**. 

## Instructions 

You are asked to solve a problem from this week's handouts and present your solution between Monday, September 16th and Friday, September 20th. You may present to Maya or Colton. You are encourage to attend your research group mates presentations, and they are encouraged to  help and support you during your presentation. However, to be clear: **each individual in each group should schedule exactly 1 appointment for exactly 1 presentation.**

## Schedule

Appointments for presentations will be offered on a first-come first-serve basis. Here is the schedule of available times. 

date | times | room | who
--- | --- | --- | ---
Mon 16 Sep 2019 | 11:00 -- 12:30 | Math 175 | Colton
Tue 17 Sep 2019 | 14:30 -- 15:30 | Math 170 | Maya, Colton
Wed 18 Sep 2019 | 11:00 -- 12:30 | Math 175 | Colton
Wed 18 Sep 2019 | 17:00 -- 18:00 | Math 175 | Maya, Colton 
Thu 19 Sep 2019 | 08:00 -- 09:00 | Math 170 | Maya, Colton
Fri 20 Sep 2019 | 11:00 -- 12:30 | Math 175 | Colton

You must schedule your presentation online! **Maya and I cannot accept walk-ins or late arrivals for anyone's presentation**. Therefore, please go to

   to schedule a time for your individual presentation. It is encouraged (but not required) that everyone in your research group schedules presentations back-to-back.

## Requirements
 
-  Please schedule at least 12 hours in advance.
 
-  Exercises, Questions, Problems, and Theorems are eligible for presentations. Definitions and non-exercises are, unfortunately, not eligible for presentations. When you choose a problem, please choose a problem without duplicating someone else's work in your group. 
 
-  I will provide you with chalk and a chalkboard to write up your solution. 

- Expect to spend about an hour preparing the solution, and about 5 minutes presenting your solution to Maya or I. 
 
-  Maya and I can help you if you get lost/stuck/nervous. 

- We are not grading you for your correctness. We are trying to help you learn a language.
 
## Schedule Conflicts

If you *absolutely cannot* make any of the appointments posted online, you may choose to take an hour long replacement test over material in the handouts for the same credit as a presentation. However, the replacement test will *absolutely be more difficult* than any 5 minute presentation. I hope you will choose the presentation.

**Please email me before Monday, September 16th** if you know you have a schedule conflict. I will ask you to provide **documentation for all six schedule conflicts.** 

## Accommodations

If you choose to opt out because of accommodations, kindly contact me (in any manner) as soon as possible before presentations are due. Alternative arrangements exist for you to practice "speaking mathematics".

Congrats! You have been assigned to the following (simulated) research groups.^[These groups *will* be rearranged periodically throughout the semester.] Your goal is to support each other in the pursuit of **novel, useful, and creative applications** of statistics. Here are your "mentors".

## Gina Maria Pomann's group (Duke)

Gina-Maria Pomann is Statistical Research Scientist and the Director of the Duke Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) Methods Core. Her primary areas of expertise focus on experimental design, image analysis, and functional data analysis. Dr. Pomann has collaborated on research projects in cardiology, hospital medicine, urology, and surgery.

## Kristin Bennett's group (Rensselaer Polytechnic)

Kristin P. Bennett is the Associate Director of the Institute for Data Exploration and Application and a Professor in the Mathematical Sciences and Computer Science Departments and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Her research focuses on extracting information from data using novel predictive or descriptive mathematical models and data visualizations, and the applications of these methods to support decision making and to accelerate discovery in science, engineering, public health and business.

## Roger Peng's group (Johns Hopkins)

Roger Peng is a Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. His group studies environmental biostatistics, specifically researching the health effects of air pollution and climate change. The focus is on statistical methods for spatial-temporal data, and the development of statistical software.

## Elizabeth Matsui's group (UT Austin)

Elizabeth Matsui, M.D., M.H.S, is a professor of population health and pediatrics and director of clinical and translational research at the University of Texas. She is a pediatric allergist-immunologist and epidemiologist and a leading international expert on environmental exposures and their effects on asthma and other allergic conditions. A major focus of Matsuiâ€™s work has been on housing-related exposures and her group identified endemic mouse infestation as the major environmental cause of asthma-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations among children in Baltimore and in other similar cities in the U.S.

## Warren Washington's group (NCAR)

Warren M. Washington is an American atmospheric scientist, a former chair of the National Science Board, and currently senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. He leads the Climate Change Research Section, a group that focuses on "the development of coupled climate models, their use on parallel supercomputing architectures, and their interpretation" specifically sensitivity and stability of the Earth system to a variety of forcings, including changes of greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar irradiance, volcanic forcing, land characteristics, and land use change.

## Time and Date

As per university policy, the official Midterm 1 for MATH 2510-001 will be physically offered 8:00am to 8:50am on Wednesday October 16, 2019, in Muenzinger E064. Isabelle "Izzy" Kraus is proctoring your midterm. 

Please arrive by 7:55am to give yourself plenty of time (e.g., the full 50 minutes) for the actual exam. The midterm will be passed out at 8:00am and collected at 8:50am. 


## Ground Rules

This is a test of your understanding---your understanding of the mathematics you will learn and create during this exam---so donâ€™t cheat yourself of an honest assessment of your abilities. This has been a hard class, so I want us to make your hard work worthwhile. This should go without saying, but the university has told me that I should emphasize the obvious: I hope that you will match my desire for your learning with your integrity for your learning.^[Quoted from Hiro Lee Tanaka, Fall 2014, Math 230a, final exam.]

The midterm is closed book, closed note, and closed internet, excepting that:

- Izzy will allow you to keep one half page of handwritten notes (e.g., the front and back half of an 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of letter paper) on your desk during the midterm.

You are allowed a personal calculator. 

- Izzy will not supply calculators.
- If you intend to use a calculator application on your phone, I expect you to notify me (by email, at `colton.grainger@colorado.edu`) before 5:00pm on October 15, 2019. 
- As a general courtesy to your peers, I expect you to put your phones into airplane mode.

You do not need to bring your own scratch paper. 

- I will supply blank scratch paper if you request it.

I expect you to legibly write your answers directly on the midterm exam.

- When you are asked for a short answer, I expect you to write in clear, grammatically correct, English sentences. 
- When you are asked for a calculator computation, I expect you to write out the explicit function name and input values which you used.

## How to pass this exam

Do what you can. You do not need to successfully answer every question to obtain an $A$ in this class. I think most of these questions are fun, so have fun!

### Friendly advice for future exams

- Come  to  class. Things  will  often  be  said  in  class  that  are  not  covered  in  the  text,  and participating in classroom discussions is an important part of the learning process.

- Read the book. The text is intended to be read in addition to classroom lectures, and it contains many more details and examples than are possible to cover in lectures.

- Do the homework. Not only does it count for a significant portion of your grade, but this is one of the best ways to study and learn.

- Come to office hours. I am happy to help you with the homework, or discuss anything we've done in class.^[Quoted from Judith Packer, Math 6310, Fall 2018, syllabus.]

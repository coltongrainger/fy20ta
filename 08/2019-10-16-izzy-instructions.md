## The basics

- Would you please hand out the exam at 8:00am and collect it (or ask it from students) by 8:50am? 
    - Two warnings (on the chalk board or aloud) for the students at 15 minutes and 5 minutes prior to 8:50am might be useful to keep people on time. 
    - Dr. Green teaches linear algebra at 9:00am in the same room, so I try to clear out by then.

- The midterm is closed book, closed note, and closed internet. However, I have told the students that they may keep one half page of handwritten notes (e.g., the front and back half of an 8.5 by 11 inch sheet of letter paper) on their desk during the midterm.

- The students are allowed a personal calculator. 
    - If a student intends to use a calculator application on their phone, I have asked them to email me for approval. 
    - A good rule of thumb is to remind students to put their phones into airplane mode, then allow anyone who doesn't have a calculator to use a phone calculator. 
    - They might complain that "according to the exam front page" phones aren't allowed. Try to quash this rebellion. (I don't want to force people to buy a calculator.)

- I have told the students they may ask for scratch paper (they should not need it).


## What to read aloud to the students before they start

- The midterm will be passed out at 8:00am and collected at 8:50am. 
- Unless your situation is exceptional, I will not accept your midterm after 8:50am.
- The midterm is closed book, closed note, and closed internet, excepting that: you may keep one half page of handwritten notes on your desk.
- Please put your phones into airplane mode.
- You are allowed a personal calculator. 
- If you have already emailed Colton for approval, you may use a phone calculator application.
- Colton expects you to legibly write your answers directly on the midterm exam.
- When you are asked for a short answer, please write in clear, grammatically correct, English sentences. 
- When you are asked for a calculator computation, please write out the explicit function name and input values which you used.
- You do not need to successfully answer every question to obtain an $A$ in this class. Colton thinks most of these questions are fun, so have fun!

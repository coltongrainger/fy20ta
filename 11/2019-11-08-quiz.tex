\begin{itemize}
    \item This quiz is out of 10 points. 
    \item Please answer each graded question, and return this quiz to me by Friday, November 8th at \textbf{8:30am}.
    \item You do not need to show work.
    \item You may not collaborate. 
    \item Please use \emph{your notes, a calculator, and a piece of scratch paper}. 
    \item You may complete any of the \emph{additional questions} to earn back points on either this quiz or the Week 10 quiz.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Graded Questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item (2 points) It is estimated that 2\% of the world's population has green eyes. How many CU students would be needed to estimate the percentage of CU students with green eyes within 0.1\% at 95\% confidence? 

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: }
\vfill

\item (1 point) Is it feasible to obtain a sample of this size from CU students? 

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: }
\vfill

\item Suppose you are going to be testing a hypothesis percentage of people with green eyes and the null hypothesis is that $p=0.02$. If your random sample of size $n=200$ found 6 people with green eyes, is this an appropriate sample to use for a hypothesis test? 

\begin{enumerate}
\item (1 point) Yes or no? 

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: }
\vfill

\item (1 point) Explain.

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: \\\ }
\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\item If your random sample of size $n=300$ found 6 people with green eyes, is this an appropriate sample to use for a hypothesis test?

\begin{enumerate}
\item (0 points) Yes or no? 

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: Yes.}
\vfill

\item (1 point) Explain.

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: }
\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\item (2 points) If the alternate hypothesis is that more than 2\% of the population has green eyes, what conclusion would you make at the 5\% significance level based on the second sample (from question 4)?

\framebox[15cm][l]{Your answer: }
\vfill

\item (2 points) If you perform 20 independent hypotheses tests, each at the 5\% level of significance,%
    \footnote{%
    Hint: What does the level of significance $\alpha$ mean in hypothesis testing? What is ``Type I error''? 
    }
what is the probability at least one of them rejects the null hypothesis?

This assessment is due Friday 2019-12-06 at 08:00 Mountain Time.
Here's the schedule for the first week of December.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mon 12-02 Introduction to model selection with linear correlation. \\
Cf. Brase and Brase, sections 10.1 and 10.2.
    \item Wed 12-04 Inferences for correlation and regression.\\Cf. Brase and Brase section 10.3.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    \framebox[\linewidth][l]{Respond in writing (\emph{on the blank space of this handout}) to the last 2 weeks, including commentary on the following syllabus.}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Here's what we've accomplished recently in class.
\\ Cf. Brase and Brase. \emph{Understandable Statistics},  Fall 2019. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Chapter 6 (the normal distribution),
        \item Chapter 7 (the confidence interval), and
        \item Chapter 8 (the hypothesis test).
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Our goal in \emph{interpreting} a word problem is to \emph{quickly} and to \emph{accurately} identify
        \begin{enumerate}
    \label{wtf}
        \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
        \item
          what is \emph{known},
        \item
          what is \emph{unknown},
        \item
          what we \emph{want to find}, and
        \item
          any \emph{mathematical relationships} between the known and unknown
          quantities.
        \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \item Our goal in actually \emph{solving} a problem is
    
        \begin{enumerate}
        \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
        \item
          to \emph{prepare} relevant mathematical information by interpreting the problem statement (see \eqref{wtf}),
        \item
          to \emph{check} that  
our model of this information is appropriate,
        \item
          to \emph{compute} relevant statistics available from this model, and then
        \item
          to \emph{conclude} by responding to the
          original problem.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}

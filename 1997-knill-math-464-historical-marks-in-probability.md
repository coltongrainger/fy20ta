- 17th century: Pascal and Fermat devise combinatorial problems associated to a player's odds in gambling "over" the possible outcomes of thrown die. 

- Inputs from J. Bernoulli A. de Moivre, T. Bayes, L. de Bufon, D. Bernoulli, A. Legendre and J. Lagrange.

- (1812) Laplace publishes *[Theorie analytique des probabilites](http://www.archive.org/details/thorieanalytiqu01laplgoog)* which exposes:
    * solutions to combinatorial problems with polynomial decompositions, 
    * approximation with finite difference formulae, and 
    * a study on the proportion ̺of female births in Paris, 
        - using an approximation to the beta integral to show that the (posterior) probability that is larger than $1/2$ is negligible (“d’une petitesse excessive”, page 380). 
        - computes the posterior probability that the probability of a male birth in London is larger than in Paris, which he finds equal to $1 - 1/328269$ (using a double integral and a continued fraction approximation!). He

Until now, an explosion of results and new directions: stochastic processes, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. Martingales, stochastic differential equations statistical mechanics, percolation, random walks, game theory or quantum field theory.

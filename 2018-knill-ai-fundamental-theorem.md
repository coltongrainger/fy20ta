113. Artificial intelligence 

Like meta mathematics or reverse mathematics, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) can be considered as part of mathematics. It is related of data science (algorithms for data mining, and statistics) computation theory (like complexity theory) language theory and especially grammar and evolutionary dynamics, optimization problems (like solving optimal transport or extremal problems) solving inverse problems (like developing algorithms for computer vision or optical character or speech recognition), cognitive science as well as pedagogy in education (human or machine learning and human motivation). There is no apparent “fundamental theorem” of AI, (except maybe Marvin Minsky’s ”The most efficient way to solve a problem is to already know how to solve it.” [300], which is a surprisingly deep statement as modern AI agents like Alexa, Siri, Google Home, IBM Watson or Cortana demonstrate; they compute little, they just know or look up - or annoy you to look it up yourself...). But there is a theorem of Lebowski on machine super intelligence which taps into the uncharted territory of machine motivation Theorem: No AI will bother after hacking its own reward function. The picture [260] is that once the AI has figured out the philosophy of the “Dude” in the Cohen brothers movie Lebowski, also repeated mischiefs does not bother it and it “goes bowling”. Objections are brushed away with “Well, this is your, like, opinion, man”. Two examples of human super intelligent units who have succeeded to hack their own reward function are Alexander Grothendieck or Grigori Perelman. The Lebowski theorem is due to Joscha Bach [26], who stated this theorem of super intelligence in a tongue-in-cheek tweet. From a mathematical point of view, the smartest way to “solve” an optimal transport problem is to change the utility function. On a more serious level, the smartest way to “solve” the continuum hypothesis is to change the axiom system. This is a cheat, but on a meta level, more creativity is possible. A precursor is Stanislav Lem’s notion of a mimicretin [275], a computer that plays stupid in order, once and for all, to be left in peace or the machine in [6] who develops humor and enjoys fooling humans with the answer to the ultimate question: ”42”. This document entry is the analogue to the ultimate question: “What is the fundamental theorem of AI”?

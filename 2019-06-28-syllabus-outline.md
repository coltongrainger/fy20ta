    > 1 Functions and Models. From the beginning, multiple representations of functions are stressed: verbal, numerical, visual, and algebraic. A discussion of mathematical models leads to a review of the standard functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, from these four points of view. Parametric curves are introduced in the first chapter, partly so that curves can be drawn easily, with technology, whenever needed throughout the text. This early placement also enables tangents to parametric curves to be treated in Section 3.4 and graphing such curves to be covered in Section 4.4. [@Ste09]

    > Things that students should get immediately: The concepts of function, domain, range, expression for function, table of values for a function, graph of a function, the notion of piecewise defined function, polynomials, rational functions, absolute value function, signum function, positive part function. 
    >
    > Things that students should get with effort: How to obtain a piecewise definition for a maximum or minimum of two functions, how to determine the domain and range of a function. [@Nai12] <http://files.vipulnaik.com/math-152/functionrapidreviewpart2.pdf>

        > Difficulty level: Easy to moderate, assuming you have seen some intuitive concept of limits before.
        >
        > Covered in class?: Probably not. We may go over some small part of this quickly before covering $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ definitions of limits.
        >
        > Things that students should definitely get: To define limits, you need to get really really close.
        >
        > There are two directions from which to approach a real number: left and right. The notation for limits and one-sided limits. The intuitive meaning of the existence of limits and of continuity, one-sided continuity, continuity on intervals. The notions of removable and jump discontinuity. 
        >
        > Things that students should hopefully get: The allusion to why taking limits for functions on a plane is harder because of multiple directions of approach. [@Nai12] <http://files.vipulnaik.com/math-152/informalintrotolimits.pdf>

    > 2 Limits and Derivatives. The material on limits is motivated by a prior discussion of the tangent and velocity problems. Limits are treated from descriptive, graphical, numerical, and algebraic points of view. (The precise definition of a limit is provided in Appendix D for those who wish to cover it.)

    - Project 3 Definition of Derivative

> It is important not to rush through Sections 2.6–2.8, which deal with derivatives (especially with functions defined graphically and numerically) before the differentiation rules are covered in Chapter 3. Here the examples and exercises explore the meanings of derivatives in various contexts. Section 2.8 foreshadows, in an intuitive way and without differentiation formulas, the material on shapes of curves that is studied in greater depth in Chapter 4.

    - 2.6 Derivatives
    - EWA 2.5 due tonight

- Week 4

    - review Exam 1

> Difficulty level: Moderate if you remember derivatives to at least the AP Calculus level. Otherwise, hard. Some things are likely to be new.
> 
> Covered in class?: Yes, but we’ll go very quickly over most of the stuff that you would have seen at the AP level, and will focus much more on the conceptual interpretation and the algebraic-verbal-graphical-numerical nexus.
> 
> What students should definitely get: The definition of derivative as a limit. The fact that the left-hand derivative equals the left-hand limit and the right-hand derivative equals the right-hand limit. Also, the derivative is the slope of the tangent to the graph of the function. Graphical interpretation of tangents and normals. Finding equations of tangents and normals. Leibniz and prime notation. The sum rule, difference rule, product rule, and quotient rule. The chain rule for composition. Differentiation polynomials and rational functions.
> 
> What students should hopefully get: The idea of derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, the notion of difference quotient and slope of chord, and the fact that the definitions of tangent that we use for circles don’t apply for general curves. How to find tangents and normals to curves from points outside them. Subtle points regarding tangent lines. [@Nai15] <http://files.vipulnaik.com/math-152/introtoderivatives.pdf>

> 5 Integrals. The area problem and the distance problem serve to motivate the definite integral. I have decided to make the definition of an integral easier to understand by using subintervals of equal width. Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various contexts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables. There is no separate chapter on techniques of integration, but substitution and parts are covered here and other methods are treated briefly. Partial fractions are given full treatment in Appendix G. The use of computer algebra systems is discussed in Section 5.8.

> 6 Applications of Integration. General methods, not formulas, are emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with Riemann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. There are more applications here than can realistically be covered in a given course. Instructors should select applications suitable for their students and for which they themselves have enthusiasm. Some instructors like to cover polar coordinates (Appendix H) here. Others prefer to defer this topic to when it is needed in third semester (with Section 9.7 or just before Section 12.4).

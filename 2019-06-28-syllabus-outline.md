- Week 1

> 1 Functions and Models. From the beginning, multiple representations of functions are stressed: verbal, numerical, visual, and algebraic. A discussion of mathematical models leads to a review of the standard functions, including exponential and logarithmic functions, from these four points of view. Parametric curves are introduced in the first chapter, partly so that curves can be drawn easily, with technology, whenever needed throughout the text. This early placement also enables tangents to parametric curves to be treated in Section 3.4 and graphing such curves to be covered in Section 4.4.

Limits are treated from descriptive, graphical, numerical, and algebraic points of view. (The precise definition of a limit is provided in Appendix D for those who wish to cover it.)

> It is important not to rush through Sections 2.6–2.8, which deal with derivatives (especially with functions defined graphically and numerically) before the differentiation rules are covered in Chapter 3. Here the examples and exercises explore the meanings of derivatives in various contexts. Section 2.8 foreshadows, in an intuitive way and without differentiation formulas, the material on shapes of curves that is studied in greater depth in Chapter 4.

Optional topics (hyperbolic functions, an early introduction to Taylor polynomials) are explored in Discovery and Laboratory Projects. (A full treatment of hyperbolic functions is available to instructors on the website.)

> 4 Applications of Differentiation. The basic facts concerning extreme values and shapes of curves are derived using the Mean Value Theorem as the starting point. Graphing with technology emphasizes the inter- action between calculus and calculators and the analysis of families of curves. Some substantial optimization problems are provided, including an explanation of why you need to raise your head 42° to see the top of a rainbow.

    - review Exam 3

> 5 Integrals. The area problem and the distance problem serve to motivate the definite integral. I have decided to make the definition of an integral easier to understand by using subintervals of equal width. Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various contexts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables. There is no separate chapter on techniques of integration, but substitution and parts are covered here and other methods are treated briefly. Partial fractions are given full treatment in Appendix G. The use of computer algebra systems is discussed in Section 5.8.

> 6 Applications of Integration. General methods, not formulas, are emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with Riemann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. There are more applications here than can realistically be covered in a given course. Instructors should select applications suitable for their students and for which they themselves have enthusiasm. Some instructors like to cover polar coordinates (Appendix H) here. Others prefer to defer this topic to when it is needed in third semester (with Section 9.7 or just before Section 12.4).

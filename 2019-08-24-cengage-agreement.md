BY CLICKING THE, I ACCEPT BUTTON, AND/OR OPENING THIS PACKAGE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND THAT YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE USE OF THE LICENSED CONTENT.
> 
> 1.0 SCOPE OF LICENSE
> 
> 1.1 Licensed Content. The Licensed Content may contain portions of modifiable content (Modifiable Content) and content which may not be modified or otherwise altered by the End User (Non-Modifiable Content). For purposes of this Agreement, Modifiable Content and Non-Modifiable Content may be collectively referred to herein as the Licensed Content. All Licensed Content shall be considered Non-Modifiable Content, unless such Licensed Content is presented to the End User in a modifiable format and it is *clearly indicated that modification of the Licensed Content is permitted*.

 
> 1.2 Subject to the End User's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cengage hereby grants the End User, a nontransferable, nonexclusive, limited right to access and view a single copy of the Licensed Content on a single personal computer system for noncommercial, internal, personal use only. 

I cannot agree with the following.

> The End User shall not 

prohibition of *distribution* and *display* =/= science in service of society

> (i) reproduce, copy, modify (except in the case of Modifiable Content), *distribute, display, transfer, sublicense, prepare derivative work(s) based on*, sell, exchange, barter or transfer, rent, lease, loan, resell, or in any other manner exploit the Licensed Content; 

but what of our intellectual property "rights"? my *own* intellectual creations are independent from Cengage's "corpus"

> (ii) remove, obscure, or *alter any notice of Cengage's intellectual property rights* present on or in the Licensed Content, including, but not limited to, copyright, trademark, and/or patent notices; or 

pay to play schema

> (iii) disassemble, decompile, translate, reverse engineer, or otherwise reduce the Licensed Content. Cengage reserves the right to use a hardware lock device, license administration software, and/or a license authorization key to control access or password protection technology to the Licensed Content. The End User may not take any steps to avoid or defeat the purpose of such measures. Use of the Licensed Content without the relevant required lock device or authorization key is prohibited.

This section is fair, I suppose.

> 2.0 TERMINATION
> 
> 2.1 Cengage may at any time (without prejudice to its other rights or remedies) immediately terminate this Agreement and/or suspend access to some or all of the Licensed Content, in the event that the End User does not comply with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In the event of such termination by Cengage, the End User shall immediately return any and all copies of the Licensed Content to Cengage.

*Here's an "official" midterm syllabus that I dug up from Canvas. We covered this and different content in class, and certainly used more sophisticated terminology.*

*To critique the following syllabus, start noticing::*

- *they're only sketchs of recipes for performing "pseudo-mathematics"*,
- *they're dated by the job markey*
- *they're contrained by calculator computation*,

*However, I want all y'all to suceed in the midterm. Let's have a "cautious" look at the material together.*
*You should check the trello board <https://trello.com/c/j6y05cHj> for about 30 pages in supplement to this midterm outline.*
*The further outlines are written so that one can both learn and study from working through problems.*

## Content on Midterm 1

1. Sampling Techniques
    - Stratified
    - Clustered
    - Simple random sample (SRS)
    - Systematic
2. Classifying Variables
    - Quantitative
    - Qualitative
3. Levels of Measurement
    - Nominal
    - Ordinal
    - Interval
    - Ratio
4. Statistics vs. Parameters
    - Samples vs. statistics
    - Populations vs. parameters
5. Experiments vs. Observational studies
    - Control vs. treatment groups
    - Variable = what we are measuring 
    - Placebo

6. Histograms
    - Quantitative
    - Class width
        * Max – Min divided by number classes (round up to nearest whole number)
        * Midpoint = middle of class
    - Class boundaries
        * Subtract 0.5 from lower limit
        * Add 0.5 to upper limit
7. Other graphs/charts
    - Ogive vs. time series
    - Circle graph
        * Mutually exclusive portions of the pie ONLY
    - Bar graph vs. pareto
    - Stem & leaf
    - Box & whisker
8. Shapes of distributions
    - Mound/symmetric
    - Skewed
    - Uniform
    - Bimodal
9. Frequency tables
    - L1 = data points
    - L2 = frequency of each data point
10. 5% trimmed mean
    - Determine n (number of data points)
    - N * 0.05 (yields number to trim off of top and bottom)
    - Re-compute mean using 1-var stats
11. Weighted averages
12. Basic Stats 
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Quartiles (Q1, Q3, IQR)
    - Min/Max
    - Mode
13. Coefficient of variation
    - $\sigma$ / $\mu$, then convert to % (aka x100)
    - What % of the mean is the standard deviation
14. Chebyshev’s Theorem
    - $1- 1/(k^2)$  gives the proportion of data that lies within a radius of $k$ $\text{\begin{texttt}standard deviations\end{texttt}}$ from the mean
    - therefore, at least 75% lies within 2 standard deviations
    - have we supplied proof enough?

15. Probability
    - Mutually exclusive events vs. independent events
        * Mutually exclusive = add to 1
        * Independent = one thing doesn’t affect probability of another thing
    - With vs. without replacement & how that affects 2-component probability problems 
    - Sample space {x, y, z}
    - $P(A)$ vs. $P(A)^c$
    - sum of probabilities always = 1
    - Common examples:
        * 6 sided die
        * 52 deck of cards
        * Roulette 
    - “Given” probabilities & contingency tables
    - P (A or B) vs. P(A & B)
    - Continuous vs. discrete random variables
    - Probability distribution tables
        * Calculate average or expected value & st. dev. based on probability distribution
16. Odds
    - odds for = ways to get what you want : ways to not get what you want
    - Odds against = reverse
        * Also called “betting odds”
    - Relation to probability
        * If odds are X:Y, X + Y = denominator of probability expression
17. Binomials
    - N, P, R (X) notation
    - Binompdf = EXACT number of outcomes
    - Binomcdf = all other scenarios
        * Calculator counts from 0 to number you put in for x
        * Use binomcdf for following scenarios:
            - “At most x”
            - “X or less”
            - “Fewer than x”
        * Must do 1 – binomcdf for the following scenarios:
            - “At least x”
            - “X or more”
            - “Greater than x”
    - Rules for using binomials
        * Independent events/trials
        * Only 2 outcomes (success or failure)
    - Using table function 
        * Y = binomial function (X, p, r,)
        * 2nd, table
        * Determine correct N for probability given 

        \newpage

18. Normal Distributions
    - Normal vs. Standard Normal
    - Symmetrical properties
    - Empirical rule
        * 68% within 1$\sigma$, 95% within 2$\sigma$, 99.7% within 3$\sigma$ of $\mu$
    - Z-scores (Negative vs. positive z-scores and how they relate to $\mu$)
        * Z = x – $\mu$
    - Find probability/area given Z-score or x-value (Normalcdf)
    - Find Z-score given area (invNorm)
19. Control Signals
    - 9 consecutive values are above mean or 9 consecutive values are below mean
    - Any value is outside of 3$\sigma$ (+/-)
    - 2 of 3 consecutive values are between +/- 2-3$\sigma$
20. Central Limit Theorem
    - As n increases, x bar distribution approaches x normal distribution
    - Need n >= 30 if we don’t know our original distribution is normal

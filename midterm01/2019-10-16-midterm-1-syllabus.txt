*Here's an "official" midterm syllabus that I dug up from Canvas. We covered this and different content in class, and used more sophisticated terminology.*

*To critique the following syllabus, start noticing::*

- *they're only sketchs of recipes for performing "pseudo-mathematics"*,
- *they're dated by the job market*
- *they're constrained by calculator computation*,

*However, I want all y'all to suceed in the midterm. Let's have a "cautious" look at the material together.*

## Content on Midterm 1

1. Sampling Techniques
    - Stratified
    - Clustered

    - Ratio
4. Statistics vs. Parameters
    - Samples vs. statistics

    - Variable = what we are measuring 
    - Placebo

6. Histograms
    - Quantitative
    - Class width
        * Max – Min divided by number classes (round up to nearest whole number)
        * Midpoint = middle of class
    - Class boundaries
        * Subtract 0.5 from lower limit
        * Add 0.5 to upper limit
7. Other graphs/charts
    - Ogive vs. time series
    - Circle graph
        * Mutually exclusive portions of the pie ONLY
    - Bar graph vs. pareto
    - Stem & leaf
    - Box & whisker
8. Shapes of distributions
    - Mound/symmetric
    - Skewed
    - Uniform
    - Bimodal
9. Frequency tables
    - L1 = data points
    - L2 = frequency of each data point
10. 5% trimmed mean
    - Determine $n$ (number of data points)
    - $N$ * 0.05 (yields number to trim off of top and bottom)
    - Re-compute mean using 1-var stats
11. Weighted averages
12. Basic Stats 
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Quartiles (Q1, Q3, IQR)
    - Min/Max
    - Mode
13. Coefficient of variation
    - take $\sigma$ / $\mu$, then convert to percentage
    - What \% of the mean is the standard deviation?
14. Chebyshev’s Theorem
    - $1- 1/(k^2)$  gives the proportion of data that lies within a radius of $k$ $\text{\begin{texttt}standard deviations\end{texttt}}$ from the mean
    - therefore, at least $75\%$ lies within 2 standard deviations

15. Probability
    - Mutually exclusive events vs. independent events
        * mutually exclusive events are represented by disjoint sets
        * Independent = one thing doesn’t affect probability of another thing
    - With vs. without replacement & how that affects 2-component probability problems 
    - Sample space $\Omega = \{x, y, z\}$
    - $P(A)$ vs. $P(A)^c$
    - if $E_1, E_2, \ldots$ are disjoint events, and their union is the entire sample space $\Omega$, then $\mathbf{P}(E_1) + \mathbf{P}(E_2) + \cdots)  = \mathbf{P}(E_1 \sqcup E_2 \sqcup \ldots) = \mathbf{P}(\Omega) = 1$.
    - Common examples:
        * 6 sided die
        * 52 card deck
        * roulette 
    - “Given” probabilities & contingency tables
    - $P (A \text{ or } B) = P(A \cup B)$ vs. $P(A \& B) = P (A \cap B)$
    - Continuous vs. discrete random variables
    - Probability distribution tables
        * Calculate average or expected value and variance based on probability distribution
16. Odds
    - the "odds for an event" is the ratio of the number ways  $P(E)$ to get the event $E$ you want against the number of ways $P(E^c)$ to not get what you want $E^c$
    - the "odds against an event" is the reverse ratio
        * these are also called “betting odds”
    - What's the relation to of betting odds to probability?
17. Binomials
    - using the TI-84 with the $(n, p, k)$ notation
        * $n$ trials
        * $p$ probability of success
        * $r$ observed sucesses
    - `binompdf` gives the PMF (or the exact number of outcomes)
    - `binomcdf` gives the CMF (or the cumulative number of outcomes up to a specified number of observed successes)
        * the calculator counts from $0$ to number you put in for $k$
        * Use `binomcdf` for following scenarios:
            - “at most $k$”
            - “$k$ or less”
            - “fewer than $k$”
        * Use $1 – \mathtt{binomcdf}$ for the following scenarios:
            - “at least $k$”
            - “$k$ or more”
            - “greater than $k$”
    - Rules for using binomials
        * the trials are independent
        * each trial has only 2 outcomes (success or failure)
        * the probability of success for each trial is constant

        \newpage

18. Normal Distributions
    - Normal vs. Standard Normal
    - Symmetrical properties
    - Empirical rule
        * 68\% within 1$\sigma$, 95\% within 2$\sigma$, 99.7\% within 3$\sigma$ of $\mu$
    - Z-scores (Negative vs. positive z-scores and how they relate to $\mu$)
        * Z = x – $\mu$
    - Find the cumulative probability given a Z-score or x-value (`normalcdf`)
    - Find the Z-score given a cumulative probability (`invNorm`)
19. Control Signals
    - 9 consecutive values are above mean or 9 consecutive values are below mean
    - Any value is outside 3$\sigma$
    - 2 of 3 consecutive values have absolute value greater between $2 \sigma$ and $3\sigma$
20. Central Limit Theorem
    - As the number of samples $n$ increases, the mean of the various samples $\bar{x}$ approaches the normal distribution
    - one needs $n \ge 30$ if one doesn't know that the original distribution is normal

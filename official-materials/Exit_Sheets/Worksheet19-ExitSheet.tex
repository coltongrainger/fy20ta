As a group, come up with answers to the following questions.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose you are going to be testing a hypothesis percentage of people with green eyes and the null hypothesis is that $p=0.02$. If your random sample of size $n=200$ found 6 people with green eyes, is this an appropriate sample to use for a hypothesis test? Explain.

\vfill

\item If your random sample of size $n=300$ found 6 people with green eyes, is this an appropriate sample to use for a hypothesis test? Explain.

\vfill

\item If the alternate hypothesis is that more than 2\% of the population has green eyes, what conclusion would you make at the 5\% significance level based on the second sample?

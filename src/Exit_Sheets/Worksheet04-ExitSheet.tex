As a group, come up with answers to the following questions.

\begin{enumerate} 
    
    \item For the following data set $$\{ 1,5,7,6,5,6,8,8,5,2,4,5,7,8,3,8,4,7 \},$$ 
        
        \begin{enumerate}
        
            \item Compute the percentage of the data that falls within $1.5$ (sample) standard deviations of the mean.

            \vfill
            
            \item How does this result compare to Chebyshev's Theorem?
            
            \vfill
            
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \item Clarice has a method of making students more successful. Over the past 6 years, her success rates have been (in no particular order) $$\{ 56, 85, 52, 13, 39, 43 \}.$$
    
    David's method for making students more successful over the past 6 years have yielded the following success rates (in no particular order) $$\{ 24, 53, 60, 69, 18, 81\}.$$
    
    Whose method would you classify as ``better"? Indicate all statistics you use to support this opinion.

As a group, come up with answers to the following questions.

\begin{enumerate} 
    
    \item Even and Odds is a game in which two people randomly show a number of fingers on one hand. Player 1 wins if the total number of fingers is odd and player 2 wins if the total number of fingers is even.
    
        \begin{enumerate}
        
            \item What is the sample space of this experiment?
            
            \vfill
            
            \item Assuming each player is equally likely to display any number of fingers, find the probability distribution.
            
            \vfill
            
            \item Is this a fair game? That is, is player 1 just as likely to win as player 2?
            
            \vfill
            
        \end{enumerate}
    

\end{enumerate}

As a group, come up with answers, with some explanation, to the following questions.

\begin{enumerate} 
    
    \item Two players play the following game: Player $A$ chooses between one of three six-sided dice:
        \begin{center}  
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Die $a$ has sides labeled $\{9, 5, 1, 9, 5, 1\}$
                \item Die $b$ has sides labeled $\{3, 8, 4, 3, 8, 4\}$
                \item Die $c$ has sides labeled $\{7, 6, 2, 7, 6, 2\}$
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{center}
        
        Player $B$ then chooses one of the remaining dice. Both players roll their chosen die and whomever rolls the higher number is then declared the winner.
        
        What is the \textbf{expected value} and \textbf{standard deviation} for each die? Does this indicate it is better to be player $A$?
    
    \vfill
    
    \item (Optional) It is in fact better to be player $B$. Can you explain why?

\end{enumerate}

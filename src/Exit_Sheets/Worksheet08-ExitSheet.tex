As a group, come up with answers, with some explanation, to the following questions.

\begin{enumerate} 
    
    \item Rank the following from most likely to least likely to occur:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A fair coin lands on heads.
            \item Three independent trials, each of which is a success with probability $0.8$, all result in success.
            \item Seven independent trials, each of which is a success with probability $0.9$, all result in success.
        \end{enumerate}
        
    \vfill
    
    \item  Suppose that we want to generate the outcome of the flip of a fair coin, but all we have at our disposal is a biased coin that lands on heads with some unknown probability $p$ that need not equal $0.5$. How can you do it?

\end{enumerate}

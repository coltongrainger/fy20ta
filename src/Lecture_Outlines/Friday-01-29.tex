\section*{4.1 What is Probability?}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Summary box on page 137 pretty much sums up the key points.

    \item A statistical experiment is any random activity that results in a definite outcome. Give examples like drawing cards, rolling dice, spinning the big wheel on ``The Price is Right", etc.
    
        \begin{itemize}
            
            \item Sample space - The set of all outcomes of an experiment
            
            \item Simple event - a single element of the sample space
            
            \item Event - any subset of the sample space
            
            \item Give an example of these terms say with dice rolling, playing cards, roulette, etc.
            
            \item Probability will always be a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive). State what is means when an event has probability 0 or 1.
            
            \item I donâ€™t care if students use fractions, decimals, or percentages.
            
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Notation
    
        \begin{itemize}
            
            \item $P(A)$.
            
            \item $P(A^c)$.
            
            \item $P(A)+P(A^c)=1$.
            
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Computed by
    
        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item Theoretical design and counting simple events.  Be sure to emphasize formula of $$P(A)=\frac{\textnormal{Number of outcomes in } A}{\textnormal{Number of all possible outcomes.}}.$$
            
            
            \item Empirical data and relative frequencies. Include the statement of the law of large numbers. Also emphasize that these methods will always \textbf{approximate} the probability of an event and is possible to never attain the exact value with such methods.
            
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Why is probability relevant to statistics?
    
        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item Probability is about assigning a likelihood to a particular outcome of an unknown experiment. The most relevant situation is assigning probabilities to sampling from a \textbf{known} population.
            
            \item Statistics is about using the results of sampling to infer information about an \textbf{unknown property} of the population.
            
        \end{itemize}
    
\end{enumerate}

\section*{4.2 Some Probability Rules---Compound Events}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item There are some formulas in this section, but often I try to de-emphasize them in trade for ``careful counting". 
    
    \item The concept of conditional probability is always tricky for students. Carefully explain the concept with emphasis that for $P(A | B)$, the event $B$ is \textbf{known} to have happened.
    
    \item Note the two key terms
    
        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item Mutually exclusive - $P(A \mbox{ and } B) = 0$
            
            \item Independent - $P(A|B) = P(A)$ or equivalently $P(B|A) = P(B)$.
            
            \item Over emphasize that $P(A \mbox{ and } B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ \textbf{only when A and B are independent events}.
            
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Be sure to explain the difference between to conjunctions \textbf{or} and \textbf{and}. The use of a Venn diagram will be of help.
    
    \item Describe a standard deck of 52 cards.
    
        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item Show how to compute $P(\mbox{Ace})$, $P(\mbox{Heart})$, \\ $P(\mbox{Ace or Heart}),$ $P(\mbox{Ace and Heart})$, $P(\mbox{Ace} | \mbox{Heart})$.
            
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Provide a contingency table and compute some probabilities with it.

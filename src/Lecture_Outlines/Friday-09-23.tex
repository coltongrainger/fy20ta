\begin{document}
The primary goal here is to give the students an outline of material to review for the Midterm on Wednesday. Since they have a quiz this day, I will not have enough time to fill in details. I plan to write this out and if someone has a specific question on something, I will then go into detail.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Remind them that Chapter Review (Chapter 4) on WebAssign is due tonight AND although Chapter Review (Chapter 5) is not due until 2/19, the midterm on 2/17 covers Chapter 5 material, so it will be to their advantage to complete it before the midterm.

    \item As far as resources during the midterm:
        
        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item Calculator (with NO internet access) When a calculator function is used, \textbf{work required is to write the function and input values used.} I do not supply calculators. If they show up without one on exam day, then they will suffer. Phones will not be allowed as a substitute.
            
            \item Formula sheet: A copy of the ``Frequently Used Formulas" for Chapter 1-5 (as shown in the back cover of the textbook; they can even see that in the online textbook).
            
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item Resources for more practice problems:
        
        \begin{itemize}
        
            \item WebAssign problems with ``Practice Another Version".  Not all problems are programmed with this option in WebAssign.
            
            \item Odd-numbered problems from the textbook where the correct answer can be checked in the back of the textbook (even the online version).
            
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item The worksheet on Monday will be a ``mini-midterm" useful for review. Homework for Monday is to start studying for the midterm.
    
\end{enumerate}

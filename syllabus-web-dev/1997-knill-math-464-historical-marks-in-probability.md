## some historical marks in probability

- (17th--18th century) Pascal and Fermat [write in correspondence](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/pascal.pdf) to understand the *combinatorics* of gambling with thrown die. 

- inputs from
    * J. Bernoulli
	* A. de Moivre
	* T. Bayes
	* L. de Bufon
	* D. Bernoulli
	* A. Legendre
	* J. Lagrange

- (1812) Laplace publishes *[Theorie analytique des probabilites](http://www.archive.org/details/thorieanalytiqu01laplgoog)* which exposes:
    * solutions to combinatorial problems with polynomial decompositions, 
    * approximation with finite difference formulae, and 
    * a study on the proportion ̺of female births in Paris
        - using an approximation to the beta integral to show that the (posterior) probability that is larger than $1/2$ is negligible (“d’une petitesse excessive”, page 380) and also
        - computes the posterior probability that the probability of a male birth in London is larger than in Paris, which he finds equal to $1 - 1/328269$ (using a double integral and a continued fraction approximation!).

- (1909) E. Borel. Strong law of large numbers.
- (1923) N. Wiener. Rigorous definition of Brownian motion.
- (1933) A. Kolmogorov. Axiomatic foundation of probability theory.

Until now, an explosion of results and new directions: stochastic processes, ergodic theory and dynamical systems. Martingales, stochastic differential equations statistical mechanics, percolation, random walks, game theory or quantum field theory.
